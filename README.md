While flying my RC airplane line-of-sight, I want to know some data from the plane (battery voltage, airspeed, turn coordination, G-forces). Maybe I can display this data in real time with some LEDs located in my peripheral vision. I'm gonna clip some electronics to my sunglasses and see how this goes :)
